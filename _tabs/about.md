## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an **Information Security student** with a strong interest in **Blue Team operations**, including **threat detection**, **log analysis**, **incident response**, and **digital forensics**.

I focus on building **defensive security** skills through **hands-on labs**, **security monitoring**, and **analysis of real-world attack techniques**. I also value **clear, well-structured technical documentation**, as I believe good security work should be both effective and well-communicated.

I actively participate in **CTF competitions**, especially challenges related to **systems and security**, which help strengthen my **analytical thinking** and **practical problem-solving** skills.
