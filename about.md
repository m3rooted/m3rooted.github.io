## "Hello, World!"

### Hi there, I'm Nguyen Duong Quang! 👋

#### Information Security Student | Aspiring Blue Team Researcher | CTF Player | INFJ-T

### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an **Information Security student** with a strong interest in **Blue Team operations**, including **threat detection**, **log analysis**, **incident response**, and **digital forensics**.

I focus on building **defensive security** skills through **hands-on labs**, **security monitoring**, and **analysis of real-world attack techniques**. I also value **clear, well-structured technical documentation**, as I believe good security work should be both effective and well-communicated.

I actively participate in **CTF competitions**, especially challenges related to **systems and security**, which help strengthen my **analytical thinking** and **practical problem-solving** skills.
Pleaseh check my [resume] if you wish to know more about me.

## Work Hard to be Lazy

_My motto to live by._
{:.lead}

> “Working hard to be lazy means putting in the effort early to build things properly, so later on you don’t have to work as hard to get the same results.”

## Re-evaluate Your Work Process

I’m naturally lazy — but in a way that makes me want to finish things properly.
If I can do two hours of work in one hour, I’ll try. But I don’t like sacrificing quality just to be faster.

I think of efficiency simply as:

efficiency = quality / time

If I want to spend less time, I either accept worse results or I change the way I work.
Rushing doesn’t help. Fixing the process does.

So whenever something feels slow or repetitive, I take that as a sign that my workflow needs to change.

## Don’t Repeat Yourself

When I look closely at what I do every day, patterns show up very quickly.
If I keep doing the same thing again and again, it usually means I’m missing a better way.

I try to break problems down to their core and ask myself:
Why am I doing this manually every time?

## Try a New Process

I’m open to changing how I work, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.
Learning new tools, writing scripts, or redesigning my workflow always costs time upfront.

But that upfront cost is exactly what allows me to be lazy later.

## Refine Yourself

“Working hard to be lazy” isn’t something I do once and forget about.
It’s a loop.

I try something new.
If it helps, I keep it.
If it doesn’t, I throw it away and try again.

In the worst case, I go back to my old way of working — except now I understand it better.
That never feels like a loss to me.
